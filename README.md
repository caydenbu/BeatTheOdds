## What is Beat The Odds?

- BeatTheOdds is a rogue-like card game built in html, css, and vanilla js. You can play on any browser any time.
- Deeply inspired from one of my favorite games Balatro, Im aimed to create a very short but pleasent experience anyone can enjoy.
- you start with nothing with but a goal to win 10 games in a row. Eventually with permanent and temporary upgrades you will see it's not as hard as it seems.
- BeatTheOdds is a browser game that should be played horizontlly if you ever plan on playing on the phone. It COULD be played vertically but the UI will most likely be very small and janky.

## Dev Notes:

- This was the first experience I've ever had creating in js. So its is very sloppy and I understand that it's a mess
- I had so little experience I didn't use modules because they would not work for some reason. Now I know I just had to host it on a local host but begginer me just didnt know that
- The whole thing is full of wierdly ordered global variables because of that and I am really too lazy and done with this project to convert it into a module structure
- Even with all of this im still kinda proud of this project, it took me forever and I'm really just glad it's done
